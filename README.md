# What?

This is a copy/paste from https://github.com/graphql-kit/graphql-faker.  
All credits goes to its authors and contributors.

# Why?

- The package is not maintained anymore.
- I could not install it on recent node versions.
- So I got the parts I wanted: just the fake server, no editor, no voyager, no extra dependencies.

# So?

Install globally
```
yarn global add graphql-faker-zero
```

Run
```
~/.yarn/bin/graphql-faker-zero graphql-faker-zero my-schema.graphql
```
